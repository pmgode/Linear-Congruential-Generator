# Linear-Congruential-Generator
Using the python the LCG is being implemented and two distributions are used i.e. Uniform and Exponential Distributions and the results were compared with the default random number generator of python using random pacakage.
1.	Implement the Linear Congruential random number Generator (LCG) in Python/MATLAB based on the following method:
             di=16807 di−1 𝑚𝑜𝑑 (2^31−1)
2.	Generate uniformly distributed inter-arrival times T (e.g., uniform(0,2)) using the LCG.
3.	Generate exponentially distributed inter-arrival times T (e.g., exponential(1)) using the LCG.
4.	Compare the results to the default RNG of Python/MATLAB.
